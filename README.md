## Introduction
Risk management is a critical aspect of corporate financial management. The ability to identify potential risks before they escalate is crucial for a business's sustainability and growth. This project aims to develop an automated risk prediction system that leverages the power of IBM Watson and IBM Auto AI Service to analyze historical financial data and forecast potential risks.

The project will involve collecting financial data, preprocessing and cleaning the data, training machine learning models using IBM Auto AI Service, evaluating the model's performance, and finally deploying the risk prediction system on Node-RED for real-time risk assessment.

## Features
- Utilize IBM Watson and IBM Auto AI Service for intelligent risk prediction.
- Interactive and user-friendly web interface for risk assessment.
- Real-time risk evaluation using Node-RED deployment.
- Automated data preprocessing and model training.

## Technologies
- IBM Watson
- IBM Auto AI Service
- Node-RED
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript

## Installation
- Clone the repository from GitHub.
- Set up the required Python environment with dependencies.
- Install Node-RED on your local machine or preferred server.

## Usage
- Launch Node-RED and import the flow provided in the repository.
- Access the web interface and input the required financial data.
- The system will predict potential risks based on the given data.

## Data Collection
Collect financial data from reliable sources or use publicly available datasets for demonstration purposes. Ensure the data is in a structured format suitable for analysis.

## Data Preprocessing
Preprocess the collected data to handle missing values, outliers, and standardize features. Perform necessary transformations to make the data compatible with the Auto AI Service.

## Model Training
Use IBM Auto AI Service to automatically train and optimize machine learning models using the preprocessed data. Select the most suitable model for risk prediction.

## Model Evaluation
Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Fine-tune the model if necessary.

## Deployment on Node-RED
Integrate the trained model into Node-RED using the available nodes or custom nodes if required. Create an interactive web interface to input financial data and display risk predictions.
